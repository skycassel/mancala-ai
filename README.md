# skycassel.github.io

This is the final project for my Artificial Intelligence class at Mount Holyoke College, in which I had to build an AI minimax opponent in combination with a website-based mancala game. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

This was a beginner project for me in terms of frontend development, so I decided to work more closely with the base HTML and CSS instead of diving into a framework like React. I originally planned to make a text-based GUI in the terminal for the mancala board instead of making it into a full stack website, which is why I chose Node.js as my framework, in addition to my familiarity with backend development from previous projects. The user can choose different color themes for the mancala board, but the most important feature (beyond basic mancala gameplay) is that the user can also choose the difficulty level of the AI opponent. Higher difficulties mean a deeper search depth for the minimax algorithm, as well as more advanced evaluation functions that consider game state information and popular mancala strategies, such as extra turns, capturing stones, and the proximity of stones to the player's mancala. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project was incredibly valuable to me in terms of learning how to work with frontend and full stack development. Although I had coded in HTML and CSS before, I had never built a complete website that integrated the two with Javascript code. Much of my time spent on this final was spent learning how to integrate these different languages and frameworks, and it has given me a deeper understanding of how to design the frontend so that the backend can do its job more efficiently. I look forward to learning more advanced Javascript frameworks and improving the graphics of the game even further, as well as the possibility of considering other common AI search and learning algorithms to implement for different levels of opponent difficulty.
